# Omni-Kit

Omni-Kit is a state-of-the-art All-In-One platform designed to showcase a comprehensive suite of highly useful utilities and developer workflows. Built with React, TypeScript, and Vite, it aims to provide an extensive standard library of daily use browser-based tools, ensuring a seamless and fully client-side developer experience.

## Intention

Our intention is to provide a single unified interface that incorporates various small applications like Encoders, Decoders, File Utilities, Security Tools, and Productivity Enhancers into one premium dashboard. The application runs fully locally for maximum privacy.

## Available Features

- **Capture & Sharing**: QR Scanner, QR Generator, File Upload simulator.
- **Data Transformation**: JSON Formatter, CSV Viewer, Base64 Tool, URL Encoder/Decoder, Text Diff.
- **Security & Identity**: JWT Decoder, Hash Generator, UUID Generator, Password Generator.
- **Productivity**: URL Builder, Timestamp Converter, Cron Parser.

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```
2. Start the local server:
   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   ```

## Design Philosophy

The app is built following strict modern design principles:

- **Responsive Architecture**: Uses minimal custom CSS and heavy reliance on modern Tailwind utility.
- **Smooth Aesthetics**: Premium dark mode interactions with subtle blurs, transitions, and glow properties following the UI Promax standard.
- **Iconography over Text**: Modern UI patterns preferring vector icons to text strings for generic actions (like "Copy" and "Check" actions).

Enjoy maximum productivity without leaving the browser!
